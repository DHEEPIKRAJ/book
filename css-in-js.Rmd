# CSS in JS
This chapter discusses writing **CSS in JS**, a technique by which CSS styles and classes are defined in _JavaScript_ rather than in separate CSS files. This technique is particularly common and useful in React, and solves a number of problems found in managing the styling of large web projects.
<!-- CSS in JS is supported [directly by React](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style) or through  [one of _many_](https://github.com/MicheleBertoli/css-in-js) external libraries; representative examples are presented below. -->



## Why CSS in JS?
In November 2014, Facebook's Christopher Chedeau gave a [**talk**](https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js) outlining many of the issues that occur when trying to develop CSS for a large application:

<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">A slide from Chedeau's talk. Click the image to view the entire deck.</p>
</div>

In short, the talk points out how defining CSS classes in fact defines **global variables**: because stylesheets are loaded across the entire page, each class definition is effectively "global" and available to each Component within that page. If you define a class `.button` somewhere in your CSS, then every Component has access to the `.button` class.

- This becomes a problem when you want to support many different components. For example, you couldn't use `.button` for multiple buttons that are all styled very differently. Instead, you would need to define different classes for each button... and be careful to make sure that the names don't "conflict" (e.g., you don't try defining a `.button-submit` for two different kinds of submit buttons!). You can use careful naming schemes (such as [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/)) to make sure that your names don't conflict, but this requires _a lot_ of developer discipline and extra thinking&mdash;and one mistake can lead to difficult to track bugs!

- Moreover, CSS rules are global variables that include _implicit details_ in their ordering (e.g., rules later in the stylesheet will override earlier ones). This is a problem when you're trying to load lots of different style sheets for different Components&mdash;which may be loaded in different orders or even asynchronously so you don't know which stylesheet will be loaded first!

The proposed solution to this problem is to define CSS style and class definition **in JavaScript as JavaScript variables**, and then using a library or build tool to convert those variables into properly name-spaced CSS classes that are included in the rendered DOM. This allow each Component to define its own styling (it's just a JavaScript variable) without worrying about conflicting global variables.

- Although the CSS and JavaScript will no longer be quite as separated, in the end the code you write will be simpler and easier to intuit. However, the DOM that these techniques produce will often look a lot messier (e.g., in the developer tools), with more complex class names or vast amounts of inline styling. This is generally an acceptable trade-off: the DOM isn't directly visible to most users, and is even ignored by screen readers.

Chedeau's talk and its solution were **hugely** influential, marking a major shift in how web developers thought about CSS. It led to the creation of [a _large_ number of projects](https://github.com/MicheleBertoli/css-in-js) that provide a different ways of including CSS in JS. These libraries all do mostly the same thing, but use different syntax to solve the problem of making it easier to develop non-global CSS styles.


## React Inline Styles
The easiest way to include CSS in JS using React is to use its built-in support for [inline styling](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style). You can define a CSS rule as a JavaScript object:


<div class="row">
<div class="column col2">
```css
/* CSS version */
h1 {
  font-family: 'Helvetica';
  color: white;
  background-color: #333;
}
```
</div>
<div class="column col2">
```js
/* JavaScript version */
const h1Style = {
  fontFamily: 'Helvetica',
  color: 'white',
  backgroundColor: '#333'
}
```
</div>
</div>

This coincidentally requires only a few changes from how you would normally write CSS properties: you need to _camelCase_ property names like when you refer to DOM styling (since `-` isn't a legal character in JavaScript variables); you need to put _all_ property values in quotes, and you use `,` instead of `;` to separate properties in the object literal.

You can then apply this object to a particular element by specifying it as the **`style`** attribute using JSX:

```jsx
<h1 style={h1Style}/>Hello World!</h1>
```

This is not actually defining a rule (it won't apply to _all_ `<h1>` elements), but rather is using **inline styling** to apply the style to only a particular element.

<p class="alert alert-warning">Normally, in non-React contexts, inline styling (specifying CSS properties in an element's `style` attribute) is considered **bad practice**. It is difficult to modify and maintain, and leads to code duplication and poor cohesion (with style rules spread out across the program). This is part of why CSS-in-JS is considered "special": it takes what is usually bad practice and shows how, when used in a particular way (in React), it can actually produce _better_ code!</p>

You can even use JavaScript objects to _namespace_ particular "style" objects, allowing you to produce something akin to CSS classes (where you can organize and apply lots of properties at once):

```jsx
const styles = {
   success: {
      backgroundColor: 'green',
      color: 'white'
   },
   failure: {
      backgroundColor: 'red',
      color: 'white'
   }
}

//...
<button style={styles.success}>You win!</button>
<button style={styles.failure}>You lose.</button>
```

Note that these aren't real CSS classes, but rather are simply names given to styles that are applied _inline_. Thus you wouldn't refer to this button as `.success` (or even `.style.success`)&mdash;it is just a classless button that has some styles applied!


## Aphrodite
React inline styles allow you to specify styling without creating global variables, but don't provide actual CSS classes. This means that you lose some semantic meaning (since you can't determine e.g., if a button is a "success" button just from the rendered DOM). You also lose the ability to handle more complex CSS rules, such as _pseudo-classes_ (particularly ones like `:hover` or `:active`) and _media queries_.

For these features, you instead will need to use a **third-party library** for support CSS-in-JS. There are [a wide variety of options](https://github.com/MicheleBertoli/css-in-js) for libraries that can be used for author robust CSS-in-JS. One of the cleanest (in the author's opinion) of these libraries is [**Aphrodite**](https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite), which is developed and maintained by [developers at Khan Academy](http://engineering.khanacademy.org/posts/aphrodite-inline-css.htm). This library allows you to specify CSS classes as JavaScript objects, and then apply those classes to a React element via the `className` attribute as normal.

You specify a collection of style classes by using the `StyleSheet.create()` method supplied by the library. This method is passed an object whose keys are the "class names", similar to in the example above. You then reference the "classes" from this object by using the library's **`css()`** function:

```jsx
import { StyleSheet, css } from 'aphrodite';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    success: {
       backgroundColor: 'green',
       color: 'white'
    },
    failure: {
       backgroundColor: 'red',
       color: 'white'
   }
});

//...
<button className={css(styles.success)}>You win!</button>
<button className={css(styles.failure)}>You lose.</button>

```

- Note that classes are still name-spaced (e.g., `styles.success`, not just `success`), you you pass the result of the `css()` function to the `className` property.

The Aphrodite library will take this `StyleSheet` you have defined and use it to **automatically generate CSS class rules** which are _injected_ into the page, just as if you had to written them inside of a `.css` file! The above JSX code will produce DOM elements:

```html
<button class="success_c72tod">You win!</button>
<button class="failure_cioc8l">You lose.</button>
```

Note that the class names start with the name you gave it, but have a number of additional characters at the end (the `_c72tod` after `success`). These characters are a [hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash) of the CSS properties contained within that classname, and are used to distinguish between different classes after they have been injected into the page and thus have become "global" variables. In effect, this library will _automatically_ produce "unique names" for each CSS class you define (differentiated by a deterministic hash at the end), so you don't need to worry about the `success` class in one Component interfering with the `success` class in another.

Aphrodite will also let you specify pseudo-selectors and media queries. These are specified as _properties_ of the classes they should apply to; the name of that property is (_a string of_) the pseudo-selector or media query, and the value of that property is another object containing the CSS properties to apply:

```js
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    //...
    hover: {
        ':hover': {
            backgroundColor:'gray'
        }
    },
    responsive: {
        '@media (min-width:598px)': {
            fontSize:'2rem'
        }
    }
});
```

- This is different from how you normally define media queries: rather than specifying a media query with a block containing the classes it should apply, you specify a class whose block contains the media query.

You can pass multiple style classes (or arrays of classes) into the `css()` method, and they will automatically be [combined](https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite#combining-styles) into a _single unique style_:

```jsx
//pass multiple styles into `css()`
<button className={css(styles.success, styles.hover)}/>You win!</button>
```

This will render an element with the DOM:

```html
<button class="success_c72tod-o_O-hover_2nsohz">You win!</button>
```

Note here that the `success` and `hover` classes have been concatenated into _a single class_ (using `-o_O-` as a separator); this is to avoid any ["ordering" issues](https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite#overriding-styles)&mdash;ensuring that the `hover` options are always applied _after_ the `success` options.

Aphrodite supports a few other features and edge cases, see the [documentation](https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite) for details.

<p class="alert alert-info">Aphrodite is just one of many different CSS-in-JS libraries, all of which have their own syntax. But almost all of them will either generate an inline style to inject into an element, or will produce their own injected stylesheet with auto-generated class names. In either case, you can focus on just styling the components without worrying about the CSS stepping on its own toes!</p>


## CSS Modules
Another popular approach to solving the "global scoping" problem with CSS is to utilize [**CSS Modules**](https://glenmaddern.com/articles/css-modules). Rather than converting JavaScript objects into CSS styles and injecting them into the page, with CSS Modules you write your class definitions in `.css` files as normal. The CSS Modules then _post-processes_ the `.css` files at build time (similar to how SASS works), converting the CSS classes into _locally scoped_ versions. These locally scoped classes are then imported as JavaScript objects so that they can be referenced in a manner similar to React Inline Styles:

```css
/* app-styles.css */
.success {
   background-color: green;
   color: white;
}

.failure {
   background-color: red;
   color: white;
}
```

```jsx
/* App.js */
import styles from './app-styles.css'

//...
<button className={styles.success}>You win!</button>
<button className={styles.failure}>You lose.</button>
```

This will render DOM elements with unique, locally-scoped class names (similar to what Aphrodite does):

```html
<button class="src-___App__success___1t37A">You win!</button>
<button class="src-___App__failure___2BnXi">You lose.</button>
```

Overall, CSS Modules has the advantages of letting you write styles in `.css` files as usual (it's clear where your CSS is located), can run slightly faster (since in the end, it's just a CSS file loaded as normal), and include a few extra features that supports easy **composition** of classes (similar to that provided by SASS).


### Ejecting from Create React App {-}
CSS Modules is a _post-processor_ that "compiles" your CSS at build time, rather than at run time. Thus in order to utilize CSS Modules, you need to configure your application's "build system" to modularize the CSS. So far, you've utilized [Create React App ](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to provide a no-configuration build system (using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) behind the scenes). However, Create React App doesn't support CSS modules by default&mdash;you need to modify the provided Webpack system to include the modularization step.

In order to modify the Webpack configuration build into Create React App, you will need to [**eject**](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#npm-run-eject) it. This process will change your project so that the Webpack configuration files are included as part of the source code, rather than loaded from a a single external library (`react-scripts`). Ejecting will allow you to modify how your React projects are built.

<p class="alert alert-warning">Ejecting is a one-way operation! Once you have "extracted" the build configurations, it's impossible to put them back (short of creating a new app and copying the files over). Be sure you want to do this! Note that if you _really_ don't want to eject, there are other, more fragile [solutions](https://medium.com/@kitze/configure-create-react-app-without-ejecting-d8450e96196a).</p>

In order to _eject_ your configuration information, run the following command:

```bash
cd path/to/app  # from the app folder
npm run eject
```

This will create two new folders in your project: `scripts` (which contains the `build` and `start` scripts, e.g., what happens when you run `npm start`), and `config/` (which contains the build configuration files).

- The Webpack configuration files specifically can be found at `config/webpack.config.dev.js` (configuration for the development server) and `config/webpack.config.prod.js` (configuration for production builds). In order to support CSS Modules, you will need to modify _both_ the development and production configuration files.

You will need to make a simple change to the Webpack configuration files to support CSS Modules. In the `webpack.config.dev.js` file, at around line 160 (as of this writing), you will find a "rule" object with the property **`test: /\.css$/`**; this specifies what processing should be applied to `.css` files. Modify this property:

```js
{
  test: /\.css$/,
  use: [
    require.resolve('style-loader'),
    {
      loader: require.resolve('css-loader'),
      options: {
        importLoaders: 1,
        //ADD THE BELOW TWO PROPERTIES!!
        modules: true,
        localIdentName: '[path]___[name]__[local]___[hash:base64:5]',
      },
    },
    //...
}
```
- These changes modify the already included [`css-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) loader so that it supports CSS Modules (a feature that is built into the loader, but not enabled by Create React App by default). The second line specify the "pattern" that should be used for generating the compiled class names: in this case, each class is named with the file path where it is used (imported), as well as its imported name.

- For `webpack.config.prod.js`, add the same `modules: true` property to the object dealing with `'css-loader'` (around line 180 as of this writing). You should not specify a custom `localIdentName`, since the default is a shorter hash that will run faster in production (though be less readable).

This is the only change you need to make to utilize CSS Modules! Now you can `import` CSS files into your React components as illustrated above, referring to each class as a _property_ of the imported object which can be assigned to an element's `className` attribute!

- Note that if you want to apply multiple classes to an element, it's often easiest to utilize the [`classnames`](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames) package, which gives you a helper method called `classNames` that will easily concatenate different classnames for you. See [the examples](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames#usage) for details.

#### react-css-modules {-}
<!-- <div class="alert alert-info"> -->
If needing to refer to classes as `style.classname` is tedious, you can use the [`react-css-modules`](https://github.com/gajus/react-css-modules) library to simplify your React code. This library allows you to "decorate" each component with extra functionality&mdash;in particular, it allows you to use a **`styleName`** attribute to specify classes directly, without needing to namespace them:

```jsx
import CSSModules from 'react-css-modules';
import styles from './app-styles.css';

class App extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                {/* Note the lack of `styles` namespaces! */}
                <button styleName={success}>You win!</button>
                <button styleName={failure}>You lose.</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default CSSModules(App, styles); //decorate the App so it reads from the styles
```

It is also possible to automate this decorating by using [`babel-plugin-react-css-modules`](https://github.com/gajus/babel-plugin-react-css-modules), which is a _webpack plugin_ that will automatically process the `styleName` attributes in the JSX _at build time_ (e.g., it changes how the JSX is compiled!). This provides a significant performance benefit (as well as making your code cleaner).

- In order to support `babel-plugin-react-css-modules`, install the library with `npm` and modify the Webpack config file. Modify the "rule" object with the property **`test: /\.(js|jsx|mjs)$/`** (which applies to `.js` files):

    ```js
    {
      test: /\.(js|jsx|mjs)$/,
      include: paths.appSrc,
      loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),
      options: {
        cacheDirectory: true,
        //ADD THE BELOW PROPERTY!!
        plugins: [ 'react-css-modules' ]
      },
    }
    ```

    This will apply the plugin whenever the JavaScript files are transpiled, allowing you to utilize the `styleName` without explicitly using the `react-css-modules` library.

- Note that this plugin has a bug whereby changes to how CSS Modules are _composed_ (see below) aren't applied when the ejected Webpack's developer server automatically reloads the browser window. See [this issue](https://github.com/gajus/babel-plugin-react-css-modules/issues/105).


### Composing Classes {-}
The other main feature of CSS Modules is the ability to **compose** classes&mdash;that is, you can specify that one CSS class _contains all the properties_ defined by another. This is similar in functionality to the `@extends` keyword in SASS (though it only affects the classes as they are _exported_ to JavaScript):

CSS classes are composed by specifying a **`composes`** property with a value that is the name of the class to "include":

```css
.base {
  font-family: 'Helvetica';
  font-size: 2rem;
}
.success {
  composes: base; /* include the .base properties */
  background-color: green; /* additional properties only for .success */
}
.failure {
  composes: base;
  background-color: red; /* additional properties only for .failure */
}
```

When applied to the previous example (the two `<button>` elements), this will render as _two separate CSS classes_:

```html
<button class="src-___App__success___1t37A src-___App__base___LeFt5">You win!</button>
<button class="src-___App__failure___2BnXi src-___App__base___LeFt5">You win!</button>
```

While you can still specify just a single class in your JavaScript (e.g., `className={style.success}`), CSS Modules will automatically apply all of the "dependent" styles to your element!

Moreover, you can also compose CSS classes **across separate files** by specifying the value as coming `from "filename"`:

```css
/* colors.css */
.success {
    color: green;
}
```

```css
/* app-styles.css */
.success {
    composes: base;
    composes: success from "../colors.css"; /* loads the color from another file */
}
```

This makes it possible to break up your CSS classes into a large number of individual "helper" modules: for example, you could have a `colors.css` file that defines coloring schemes, a `fonts.css` file that defines classes that only handle fonts (e.g., `.large`), a `layout.css` file that defines classes that only handle layout (e.g., `padding-small`, `margin-top-large`), and so forth:

```css
/* example from docs */
.element {
  composes: large from "./fonts.css";
  composes: dark-text from "./colors.css";
  composes: padding-all-medium from "./layout.css";
  composes: subtle-shadow from "./effect.css";
}
```

In effect, you can use different files you develop your own set of Bootstrap-style utility classes!

- This may seem like overkill for a small app, but can be a great help when you're trying to design a large app (e.g., the size of Facebook) or a want to be able to consistently "theme" related but vastly different apps (think Gmail and Google Drive).
